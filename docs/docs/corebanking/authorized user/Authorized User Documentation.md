#### WHAT IS AN AUTHORIZED USER?

An Authorized User is a person allowed to manage your account.
For Deposit accounts, Authorized Users are usually family members, such as a child or a spouse and they do not have account decision making permissions.
They can use another person's account but arenâ€™t legally responsible for paying bills associated with the account.
Authorized Users **<u>are not</u>** Primary Account Holders and their Account level privileges differ.
