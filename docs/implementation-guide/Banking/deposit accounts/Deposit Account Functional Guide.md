## About the Product

#### What is a Deposit Account?
A bank account with a financial institution to let you deposit, transfer and withdraw money, subject to terms that are defined in the account agreement.

#### Benefits of a Deposit Account
Deposit Accounts offer high liquidity. Your money is always available offering the convenience to pay bills, deposit paychecks and transfer money between deposit accounts; and there are no penalties for early withdrawal to worry about.

#### How safe is your money?
Deposits made are eligible for Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) protection upto $100,000 per insured category per depositor. 

The Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation is a Canadian federal Crown Corporation created by Parliament in 1967 to provide deposit insurance to depositors in Canadian commercial banks and savings institutions.
