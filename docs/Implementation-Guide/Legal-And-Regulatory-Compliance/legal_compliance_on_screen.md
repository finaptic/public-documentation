# Legal and Compliance On Screen Requirements

### **Sales Practice**

Before starting the onboarding sequence, prospective customers must have had the opportunity to review your product offering(s) and been presented with different options should you offer them. The information you present should educate and assist the prospective customer to determine whether your products and services are suitable for their needs and budget. You will take measures to avoid the risk of mis-selling, tied selling and breaches of market conduct obligations, such as using pressure tactics, and placing sales and rewards ahead of customer needs. A self-guided discovery processs should allow the prospective customer to ask questions, seek objective advice and take time to decide whether to proceed to open or apply for a product with you. 

### **Clear, simple and not misleading**

All of your communications must be **"clear, simple and not misleading"**. This includes advertising, product descriptions, agreements on screen content, and communication with consumers.  Consumer protection provisions explicitly call out these requirements when communicating about financial products and services. 

In its document CG-3 on Clear Language, the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC) sets out its expectations on how financial institutions can ensure clear language and presentation in their communications with their consumers by applying the following 5 principles: 

- Know your audience.
- Make your material understandable by planning your text.
- Write clearly.
- Use the visual presentation to enhance your text.
- Test your material.

The *Competition Act* more generally applies the 'clear, simple and not misleading' principle to all advertising and the 'general impression test' to determine whether a representaiton is misleading. When evaluating whether your advertising, consider how the 'ordinary hurried purchaser' (or 'credulous and inexperienced consumer') would understand the essential elements of your offer. 

***Disclaimers***

Try to avoid the use of marketing disclaimers. The use of footnotes and fine print could raise questions about the veracity of the marketing offer and suggest obfuscation of the entire story. 

However, if you choose to or need to use a disclaimer, keep the following principles from the Competiton Bureau in mind: 

Â 1. A disclaimer that expands on or clarifies possible ambiguities in the main body of an advertisement is unlikely to mislead consumers; assuming that the general impression of the advertisement is not otherwise misleading

- Given space constraints and to avoid aesthetic clutter in the main body of an ad, fine print can be perfectly legitimate if it adds useful information to a truthful ad.
2. A disclaimer that is used to restrict, contradict or somehow negate the message to which it relates likely confuses consumers and is deceptive
- If the main body of the ad creates a deceptive general impression in itself, the fine print disclaimer may not do much to alter that deception.
  
  Additional guidance:

- Disclaimer should be prominent, clear and close to main claim being clarified  

- Main claim in the advertisement should be able to stand alone, without a disclaimer

- Disclaimer must be likely to be read and not likely to alter the general
  impression of the ad

***Ask yourself***

Here are some questions to guide the writing, graphics, design and presentation of your content

- Is it clear?

- Is it simple?

- Is it not misleading?
  
  - Is all of it true?
  
  - Is any information missing?
  
  - Is any information buried in disclaimers
  
  - Does the illustration match the words?

Finally: imagine your customer as Homer Simpson. Does it still work?

### Product Advertising Regulations

In addition to the requirement to be clear, simple and not misleading in advertisements, some banking products have disclosure requirements specific to when the product is being promoted.  Finaptic will provide the information required if you offer the product. You will be responsible for on screen presentment.

Deposit Accounts

- can't advertise interest-bearing deposit or debt obligations unless the advertisement discloses, in accordance with the regulations, how the amount of interest is to be calculated. 
  
  Credit Cards

- solicitations (typically means direct advertising) must specify 
  
  - the fixed rate of interest, the annual interest rate, (example: Purchase Intereste Rate and Cash Advance Interest Rate) or the variable interest rate (more specific details required)
  
  - the day on or after which interest accrues and information concerning any grace period that applies (example: Interest-free Grace Period at least 21 days); and
  
  - the amount of any non-interest charges (examples: annual fee, cash advance fee, overlimit fee, dishonoured payment)
    
    Tip: the Information Box could be used to provide this information for ease of reference and to avoid any errors.

- advertising (typically means public advertising) must specify
  
  - Annual Fees and Interest Rates (both must have same prominence on screen)

### Product Disclosure Requirements

Banking products all have disclosure requirements to inform the prospective customer of important details like charges and interest rates. The disclosures for Deposit Accounts do not need to appear in a specified format. The disclosures for Credit Cards and Prepaid Product must be presented in a prescribed Information Box format. Finaptic will provide this information.

Deposit Accounts 

- Charges: you must disclose to your customers and the public charges that apply to deposit accounts in writing on your website and points of service through which products or services are offered in Canada. Even though the app is not defined as a 'point of service' we require you to include this information on the app. 

- Changes or new charges: each customer in whose name a deposit account is kept (or to whom the customer has instructed to send the notice) must receive written notice:
  (a) if the customer is provided a statement of account: at least 30 days before effective date of increase or new charge.
  (b) if the customer is not provided a statement of account: by means of a notice on your website and app, and by electronic notice at least 60 days before effective date of increase or new charge. 

Credit Cards

To be added: sample Information Box

### CDIC Insurance

**CDIC Guidance**

- Must disclose whether account is CDIC insured
- BUT only CDIC member institutions can display CDIC signage
- FAQs to address questions about CDIC insurance [Financial Community and Trustees - cdic.ca](https://www.cdic.ca/financial-community/)

### Onboarding

The onboarding sequence starts from legal and compliance screens. Ideally the applicant would agree to the app terms and conditions, privacy policy and electronic communications agreement, before they provide any personal information.

You may allow an applicant to enter personal data and provide consent to the terms and conditions after; but before the identification process. However, it is prohibited to store any personal data of the applicant before they agree to the Privacy Policy.

### Obtaining Meaningful Consent

Under privacy laws, organizations are generally required to obtain meaningful consent for the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. Banking regulations require financial institutions to obtain express consent for financial products and services. 

Communication seeking consent must be clear, simple and not misleading.

Examples of express consent (not fancy, but clear): 

"I have read and agree to the App Terms and Conditions."

"Yes, I read and accept the Privacy Policy."
"I consent to opening a deposit account. I have read and agree to the deposit account fee guide and agreement."

In order for the consents to be binding, applicants must have read and agreed to the Electronic Communications Agreement, which includes provisions regarding electronic signatures and receiving regulatory documents electronically.

### TAX RESIDENCY - FATCA AND CRS

To comply with the [Common Reporting Standard](http://www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/common-reporting-standard) (CRS), you must collect specific tax information from each account holder at sign-up. You must also determine whether the account holder is subject to US tax law to comply with the [Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/corporations/foreign-account-tax-compliance-act-fatca "Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)") (FATCA). We have drafted on screen questions and an explanation about why we need to collect this information.  We recommend that you use the same language. 

### App Section

Your app should have a section that gives your customers access to:  

- The most current agreements

- Information about "Tied Selling"

- Trade-mark legal disclosures

- How we will communicate with you

- Customer Support

You can name and organize the above sections to suit your app and brand.

#### Current Agreements

Documents drafted by Finaptic will be stored and maintained by Finaptic. The customer needs to be able to download, save or print the documents to which they have consented.

1. App Terms and Conditions - this is your app terms and conditions. Finaptic will review.

2. Privacy Policy - this is your Privacy Policy, but must include the clauses from the Finaptic Privacy Policy. Finaptic will review.

3. Electronic Communications Agreement - Finaptic drafted document but can have your brand.

4. Product Fee Guide and Account Agreement - Finaptic drafted document but can have your brand.

#### Tied Selling (in app Content)

**What is coercive tied selling?**

Banks in Canada areÂ **not**Â allowed to engage in âcoercive tied sellingâ or âforced purchases.â  While this is a requirement for banks, as a distributor of banking products, we also respect this prohibition.

This means that we are not allowed to unduly pressure or coerce you into obtaining a banking product or service from us, as a condition for obtaining another banking product or service from us. This practice, called coercive tied selling, is illegal in Canada for banks.

For example, if you apply for a credit card, we cannot make you buy another product or service, like requiring you to open a deposit account, as a condition for obtaining a credit card.

**What is not coercive tied selling?**

However, banks (and their affiliates) are allowed to offer consumers, in conjunction with one of their products, another product or service on more favourable terms than they normally would provide. This is similar to a company offering a deal or discount to its customers if they purchase more than one item from the company. 

For example, if you apply for a credit card, we might offer you a lower annual fee if you also open a deposit account. 

#### Trademark Legal Disclosures (in app Content<u> TBC)</u>

<sup>(R)</sup> NATSOLUTION is a registered trade-mark of Nat Can, *used under license.*

<sup>(R)</sup> Mastercard is a registered trade-mark or *service mark* of Mastercard or its subsidiaries in Canada, *used under license*. 

<sup>(R)</sup> Cirrus is a registered trade-mark or *service mark* of Mastercard or its subsidiaries in Canada.

<sup>(R)</sup> *Interac* e-Transfer is a registered trade-mark of Interac Corp., used under license.

#### How we will communicate with you (in app Content)

**We will never ask you to provide personal, login or account information by email.** If we need to reach you, we will send you a chat message in app or we will call you at the telephone number you have provided us. If you want to reach us, please use the in app chat. You may also check out the Customer Support section for more information.
