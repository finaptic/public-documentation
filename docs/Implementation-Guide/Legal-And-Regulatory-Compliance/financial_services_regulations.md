# Financial Services Regulations

The Canadian financial services regulations are a cornerstone for protecting the financial system in Canada and abroad. 

Some of the following information and infographic is reproduced in part from the Competiton Bureau report dated December 14, 2017: https://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/04322.html


## The Role of Regulation and Regulators
The goal of most regulation is to correct for negative externalities that will not be corrected by market forces alone. Regulation also plays a role in mitigating risks that may be ignored when companies pursue higher profitability. Risks that regulation in financial services aims to mitigate include systemic risk (i.e. risk of financial system failure), prudential risk, institutional governance, risks to consumers and investors, asymmetry of information (between financial services consumers and suppliers) and financial illiteracy, counterparty risks in payments, privacy risk and abuse of the financial system to hide or facilitate criminal activity. In this context, financial services regulations exist to protect the systems in place and to govern the conduct of those who provide services.

In summary, regulators for the Canadian financial system:
* enforce applicable laws; 
* prosecute cases of market misconduct; 
* license providers of financial services; 
* protect consumers; 
* investigate complaints; and 
* maintain confidence in the financial system.

Part 1 of the infographic is an organizational chart that illustrates the relationship between Canada's federal financial regulators and policymakers. 

Part 2 of the infographic is an organizational chart to illustrate the broad responsibilities of Canada`s provincial and territorial governments. This is represented by the second-tier which outlines responsibilities in three broad categories: provincially (or territorially) regulated financial institutions (such as most credit unions), securities and consumer protection.

### Regulation at the federal level

The **Minister of Finance** and the **Department of Finance Canada** are responsible for fiscal policy and financial sector regulatory policy and legislation. The Minister of Finance oversees a number of agencies and Crown corporations in the finance portfolio including the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (**OSFI**), the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (**FCAC**), the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (**FINTRAC**) and Canadian Deposit Insurance Corporation (**CDIC**). While the Minister of Finance sets policy and creates legislation, these agencies and corporations carry out the administration or enforcement of that legislation. Key statutes under the Minister of Finance's purview include the Bank Act, Payment Card Networks Act, Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act and Canadian Payments Act.

The **Bank of Canada** is responsible for setting monetary policy in Canada, targeting inflation through manipulation of overnight interest rates (i.e. the rate at which financial institutions borrow from each other). It oversees major clearing and settlement systems, providing those systems with banking services (pursuant to the Payment Clearing and Settlement Act); promotes financial stability globally with international bodies; and provides liquidity to the financial system. The Bank of Canada is also responsible for issuing currency. Some of the primary risks concerning the Bank of Canada include the safety, soundness, stability and efficiency of the financial system.

**OSFI** regulates and supervises more than 400 federally regulated financial institutions (FRFIs) and 1,200 pension plans to determine the soundness of their financial condition and whether they are meeting their obligations as set out in legislation. FRFIs include all banks in Canada as well as all federally incorporated or registered trust and loan companies, insurance companies, cooperative credit associations, fraternal benefit societies and private pension plans. OSFI’s mandate is to protect depositors, policyholders and other creditors, while allowing financial institutions to compete and take reasonable risks.

The **FCAC** ensures that federally regulated financial institutions (i.e. those overseen by OSFI and the Department of Finance) comply with consumer protection measures set out in legislation and regulation. It also conducts research and promotes financial education and awareness of consumer rights and responsibilities.

**FINTRAC** is Canada’s financial intelligence unit, assisting in the detection, prevention and deterrence of money laundering and terrorist activity financing. It provides a unique contribution to the safety of Canadians and the protection of the integrity of Canada’s financial system through the enforcement of the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act.

The **CDIC** is a federal Crown corporation that contributes to the stability of the financial system by providing deposit insurance against the loss of eligible deposits at member institutions in the event of their failure. Premiums for deposit insurance are paid by member institutions.

In addition to direct government involvement, **Payments Canada** has a legislative mandate and is responsible for the clearing and settlement infrastructure, processes and rules that are essential to the exchange of billions of dollars each day (i.e. interbank payments). Payments Canada operates three payments systems: 

* the Large Value Transfer System
* the Automated Clearing Settlement System
* the US Dollar Bulk Exchange.

The organization also oversees the rules for this key payments infrastructure and ensures its smooth and efficient operation.

### Regulation at the provincial and territorial level

**Provincial and territorial governments** are responsible for policy and regulatory development related to provincially‑ or territorially‑regulated financial institutions (such as most credit unions) and securities. Securities are regulated through 13 distinct provincial and territorial authorities, each administering separate laws and regulations. Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario and Québec are the four largest provincial regulators, supervising the vast majority of the securities market. Most provinces and territories also have consumer protection legislation, some of which deals with financial transactions and agreements.

In relation to the three areas that are the focus of this study—payments and payment systems, lending and investment dealing and advice—securities laws have a significant impact on the entry and growth of FinTech. The goal of securities legislation is to foster fair and efficient capital markets and protect investors. Securities rules include regulation of the conduct of securities issuers and dealers as well as their reporting requirements and business structures. To harmonize, improve and coordinate securities legislation and regulation across jurisdictions, each of the provincial and territorial securities regulators have combined to create the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) umbrella organization.

In addition to provincial securities authorities, two self‑regulating organizations, the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) and the Mutual Fund Dealers Association of Canada (MFDA), have oversight authority regarding the conduct of investment and mutual fund dealers.

Each of these regulatory or oversight authorities has an important role to play in ensuring that financial markets are safe, secure, efficient and useful to Canadians. They promote confidence in the financial system through consumer protection and literacy, while mitigating exposure to unnecessary risks. There is no doubt they are important and necessary to the operation of our financial system.
