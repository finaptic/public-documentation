# Financial Services Regulations

The Canadian financial services regulations are a cornerstone for protecting the financial system in Canada and abroad. Below we have provided general information about how financial services are regulated and links to websites with more details. 

Some of the following information and infographic is reproduced in part from the Competiton Bureau report dated December 14, 2017: https://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/04322.html

## The Role of Regulation and Regulators

The goal of most regulation is to correct for negative externalities that will not be corrected by market forces alone. Regulation also plays a role in mitigating risks that may be ignored when companies pursue higher profitability. Risks that regulation in financial services aims to mitigate include systemic risk (i.e. risk of financial system failure), prudential risk, institutional governance, risks to consumers and investors, asymmetry of information (between financial services consumers and suppliers) and financial illiteracy, counterparty risks in payments, privacy risk and abuse of the financial system to hide or facilitate criminal activity. In this context, financial services regulations exist to protect the systems in place and to govern the conduct of those who provide services.

In summary, regulators for the Canadian financial system:

* enforce applicable laws; 
* prosecute cases of market misconduct; 
* license providers of financial services; 
* protect consumers; 
* investigate complaints; and 
* maintain confidence in the financial system.

Part 1 of the infographic is an organizational chart that illustrates the relationship between Canada's federal financial regulators and policymakers. 

Part 2 of the infographic is an organizational chart to illustrate the broad responsibilities of Canada`s provincial and territorial governments. This is represented by the second-tier which outlines responsibilities in three broad categories: provincially (or territorially) regulated financial institutions (such as most credit unions), securities and consumer protection.

### Regulation at the federal level

The **Minister of Finance** and the **Department of Finance Canada** are responsible for fiscal policy and financial sector regulatory policy and legislation. The Minister of Finance oversees a number of agencies and Crown corporations in the finance portfolio including the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (**OSFI**), the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (**FCAC**), the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (**FINTRAC**) and Canadian Deposit Insurance Corporation (**CDIC**). While the Minister of Finance sets policy and creates legislation, these agencies and corporations carry out the administration or enforcement of that legislation. Key statutes under the Minister of Finance's purview include the Bank Act, Payment Card Networks Act, Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act and Canadian Payments Act.

The **Bank of Canada** is responsible for setting monetary policy in Canada, targeting inflation through manipulation of overnight interest rates (i.e. the rate at which financial institutions borrow from each other). It oversees major clearing and settlement systems, providing those systems with banking services (pursuant to the Payment Clearing and Settlement Act); promotes financial stability globally with international bodies; and provides liquidity to the financial system. The Bank of Canada is also responsible for issuing currency. Some of the primary risks concerning the Bank of Canada include the safety, soundness, stability and efficiency of the financial system.

**OSFI** regulates and supervises more than 400 federally regulated financial institutions (FRFIs) and 1,200 pension plans to determine the soundness of their financial condition and whether they are meeting their obligations as set out in legislation. FRFIs include all banks in Canada as well as all federally incorporated or registered trust and loan companies, insurance companies, cooperative credit associations, fraternal benefit societies and private pension plans. OSFI’s mandate is to protect depositors, policyholders and other creditors, while allowing financial institutions to compete and take reasonable risks.

The **FCAC** ensures that federally regulated financial institutions (i.e. those overseen by OSFI and the Department of Finance) comply with consumer protection measures set out in legislation and regulation. It also conducts research and promotes financial education and awareness of consumer rights and responsibilities.

**FINTRAC** is Canada’s financial intelligence unit, assisting in the detection, prevention and deterrence of money laundering and terrorist activity financing. It provides a unique contribution to the safety of Canadians and the protection of the integrity of Canada’s financial system through the enforcement of the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act.

The **CDIC** is a federal Crown corporation that contributes to the stability of the financial system by providing deposit insurance against the loss of eligible deposits at member institutions in the event of their failure. Premiums for deposit insurance are paid by member institutions.

In addition to direct government involvement, **Payments Canada** has a legislative mandate and is responsible for the clearing and settlement infrastructure, processes and rules that are essential to the exchange of billions of dollars each day (i.e. interbank payments). Payments Canada operates three payments systems: 

* the Large Value Transfer System
* the Automated Clearing Settlement System
* the US Dollar Bulk Exchange.

The organization also oversees the rules for this key payments infrastructure and ensures its smooth and efficient operation.

### Regulation at the provincial and territorial level

**Provincial and territorial governments** are responsible for policy and regulatory development related to provincially‑ or territorially‑regulated financial institutions (such as most credit unions) and securities. Securities are regulated through 13 distinct provincial and territorial authorities, each administering separate laws and regulations. Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario and Québec are the four largest provincial regulators, supervising the vast majority of the securities market. 

Most provinces and territories also have consumer protection legislation, some of which deals with financial transactions and agreements.

In relation to the three areas that are the focus of this study—payments and payment systems, lending and investment dealing and advice—securities laws have a significant impact on the entry and growth of FinTech. The goal of securities legislation is to foster fair and efficient capital markets and protect investors. Securities rules include regulation of the conduct of securities issuers and dealers as well as their reporting requirements and business structures. To harmonize, improve and coordinate securities legislation and regulation across jurisdictions, each of the provincial and territorial securities regulators have combined to create the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) umbrella organization.

In addition to provincial securities authorities, two self‑regulating organizations, the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) and the Mutual Fund Dealers Association of Canada (MFDA), have oversight authority regarding the conduct of investment and mutual fund dealers.

Each of these regulatory or oversight authorities has an important role to play in ensuring that financial markets are safe, secure, efficient and useful to Canadians. They promote confidence in the financial system through consumer protection and literacy, while mitigating exposure to unnecessary risks. There is no doubt they are important and necessary to the operation of our financial system.

## Consumer Protection

### The Financial Consumer Agency of Canada - Federal

The Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC) supervises all federally regulated financial institutions to ensure that they comply with federal consumer protection provisions. It also educates consumers and monitors industry codes of conduct and public commitments designed to protect consumer interests.

These consumer protection provisions cover a variety of operating practices that directly affect your customers. For example, financial institutions are required by law to provide consumers with information about their fees, interest rates and complaint-handling procedures. Financial institutions are also required to obtain express consent for new products and services, as well as credit limit increases, and are prohibited from 'tied-selling' and deceptive sales practices. 

#### Sales Practice

See Legal Compliance on Screen for more information. 

#### Consumer Complaints

The Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC) investigates complaints that relate to a possible breach of market conduct obligations under federal regulations. Part of FCAC's role is to also ensure that federally regulated financial institutions have a complaint-handling process in place. In that regard, you are required to provide information about how the complaint handling process works. 

Customers can make complaints directly to the FCAC. FCAC reviews complaints on a case-by-case basis to determine whether a federal consumer protection issue exists, and if so, what necessary action should be taken.

All of the product agreements will include a section on how to make a complaint to the FCAC, addressed to: 

Financial Consumer Agency of Canada
Enterprise Building, 6th Floor
427 Laurier Avenue West
Ottawa, ON K1R 1B9
Toll-free: 1-866-461-3222 

[www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca](http://www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca)

Your app must also include a section on **how to make a complaint**. Finaptic will provide the content for that section.

#### Tied Selling

**What is coercive tied selling?**
Section 459.1 of the Bank Act prohibits banks from practicing coercive tied selling. More specifically, it is against the law for a bank to “impose undue pressure on, or coerce, a person to obtain a product or service from a particular person, including the bank and any of its affiliates, as a condition for obtaining another product or service from the bank.” You cannot be unduly pressured to buy a product or service that you don’t want from a bank or one of its affiliates to obtain another bank product or service. 

If you qualify for a product, a banking representative is not allowed to unduly pressure
you to buy another unwanted product or service as a condition of obtaining the product you want.

## CDIC Insurance

The [Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation](https://www.cdic.ca/) (CDIC) is the federal Crown corporation that contributes to the stability of the Canadian financial system by providing deposit insurance against the loss of eligible deposits at member institutions in the event of failure.

[Eligible deposits](https://www.cdic.ca/your-coverage/protecting-your-deposit/) are automatically covered to a limit of $100,000 per [insured category](https://www.cdic.ca/your-coverage/how-deposit-insurance-works/) at each CDIC [member financial institution](https://www.cdic.ca/your-coverage/list-of-member-institutions/). Members include banks, federally regulated credit unions, as well as loan and trust companies and associations governed by the [*Cooperative Credit Associations Act*](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-41.01/) that take deposits.

CDIC is not a bank. CDIC is not a private insurance company.

CDIC funded by premiums paid by their member institutions and do not receive public funds to operate.

Parliament established the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1967 to achieve the following:

- provide insurance against the loss of part or all of deposits;
- promote and otherwise contribute to the stability of the financial system in Canada;
- act for the benefit of depositors while minimizing loss.

Finaptic will inform you if the accounts you are offering are eligible for CDIC coverage and the language that you can present on your website and app. 

## CASL, Privacy and Competition Bureau - concerns about mobile app companies

On November 26, 2020, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC) and the Competition Bureau (Bureau) issued letters to 36 companies involved in the mobile applications industry in Canada advising that they review their practices and take preventive or corrective measures where necessary.

The federal agencies reminded mobile app companies of their obligations under Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL), and those related to the promotion, installation and use of mobile apps under the *Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act* (PIPEDA) and the *Competition Act*. They also encouraged the companies to take action to help prevent activities that raise concerns, such as:

- apps that make false or misleading claims to promote a product, a service or a business interest;
- apps that collect or use personal information, such as electronic addresses, without consent;
- apps that do not properly identify their functions (such as allowing information sharing with other computers or automatically downloading other programs on the user’s devices) in order to obtain informed consent from the user prior to installation;
- apps designed to spam users’ friends and contacts.

These activities put Canadians at risk of fraud, identity theft and financial loss, among other things.

Enforcement in the digital economy and particularly in relation to the use and collection of consumer data is likely to remain a high priority for Canadian regulators. Companies involved in the mobile app industry are in a unique position to detect, prevent and stop practices that could harm consumers.

[Joint letter from federal enforcement agencies to remind mobile app industry of obligations associated with Canada’s anti-spam legislation - Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada](https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-news/news-and-announcements/2020/let_201126/) 

### Competition Act

To contravene the Competition Act, a representation must be "false or misleading in a material respect." The basic rule that is used to determine whether a contravention has taken place is the 'general impression test': The general impression conveyed by a representation, as well as its literal meaning, will be taken into account when determining whether or not the representation is deceptive in a material respect (“materiality” is not an element of a deceptive electronic message). 

In 2012, the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) provided additional guidance and understanding of what test to consider when determinining whether an advertisiment is misleading in a material respect in its decision *Richard v. Time Inc.* [2012 SCC 8 (CanLII) | Richard v. Time Inc. | CanLII](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2012/2012scc8/2012scc8.html). While the case involved the *Quebec Consumer Protection Act,* rather than the *Competition Act*, the provisions as with other consumer protection laws in other province are all similar. 

The SCC held that the general impression test is one of first impression, which is distinct from a rushed or partial reading of an advertisement. The general impression is the one a person has after an initial contact with the entire advertisement, and incorporates both the physical layout and the meaning of the words used. The SCC further explained that the general impression must be analyzed from the perspective of the average consumer, without considering his/her personal attributes, who is “credulous and inexperienced” and takes “no more than ordinary care to observe that which is staring him or her in the face”. 
At paragraph 67, the SCC describes ""The general impression test provided for in [s. 218](https://www.canlii.org/en/qc/laws/stat/cqlr-c-p-40.1/latest/cqlr-c-p-40.1.html#sec218_smooth) *[C.P.A.](https://www.canlii.org/en/qc/laws/stat/cqlr-c-p-40.1/latest/cqlr-c-p-40.1.html)* must be applied from a perspective similar to that of “ordinary hurried purchasers”, that is, consumers who take no more than ordinary care to observe that which is staring them in the face upon their first contact with an advertisement.  The courts must not conduct their analysis from the perspective of a careful and diligent consumer. 

[68] Obviously, the adjectives used to describe the average consumer may vary from one statute to another.  Such variations reflect the diversity of economic realities to which different statutes apply and of their objectives.  The most important thing is not the adjectives used, but <u>the level of sophistication expected of the consumer</u>.""

The method for assessing the general impression is therefore two-fold: (1) describe the general impression that the representation is likely to convey to a credulous and inexperienced consumer; and (2) determine whether that general impression is true to reality. If the answer at the second step is no, the merchant has engaged in a prohibited practice. The court also confirmed that there is a presumption of prejudice to the consumer such that the consumer does not have to prove that the merchant intended to mislead.

**Penalties for Deceptive Advertising (*Competition Act*)** (source: [False or misleading representations - Competition Bureau Canada](https://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/00513.html#section2.4) )

The Competition Act provides criminal and civil regimes to address false or misleading representations.

| Civil                                                                                                                           | Criminal                                                                                                              |

| Paid restitution to purchasers                                                                                                  | Upon indictment, a fineto without upper limit at the discretion of the Court, imprisonment of up to 14 years, or both |
| Freeze assets                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                       |

**Section 52** of the Act is a criminal provision. It prohibits knowingly or recklessly making, or permitting the making of, a representation to the public, in any form whatever, that is false or misleading in a material respect. Under this provision, it is not necessary to demonstrate that any person was deceived or misled; that any member of the public to whom the representation was made was within Canada; or that the representation was made in a place to which the public had access. Subsection 52(4) directs that the [general impression](https://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/01315.html#Gen) conveyed by a representation, as well as its literal meaning, be taken into account when determining whether or not the representation is false or misleading in a material respect.

Any person who contravenes section 52 is guilty of an offence and liable to a fine of up to $200,000 and/or imprisonment up to one year on summary conviction, or to fines in the discretion of the court and/or imprisonment up to 14 years upon indictment.

**Paragraph 74.01(1)*(a)*** of the Act is a civil provision. It prohibits the making, or the permitting of the making, of a representation to the public, in any form whatever, that is false or misleading in a material respect. Under this provision, it is not necessary to demonstrate that any person was deceived or misled; that any member of the public to whom the representation was made was within Canada; or that the representation was made in a place to which the public had access. Subsection 74.03(5) directs that the [general impression](https://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/01315.html#Gen) conveyed by a representation, as well as its literal meaning, be taken into account when determining whether or not the representation is false or misleading in a material respect.

If a court determines that a person has engaged in conduct contrary to paragraph 74.01(1)*(a)*, it may order the person not to engage in such conduct, to publish a corrective notice, to pay an administrative monetary penalty and/or to pay restitution to purchasers. When the court orders the payment of administrative monetary penalties, on first occurrence, individuals are subject to penalties of up to $750,000 and corporations, to penalties of up to $10,000,000. For subsequent orders, the penalties increase to a maximum of $1,000,000 in the case of an individual and $15,000,000 in the case of a corporation. The court also has the power to order interim injunctions to freeze assets in certain cases.

**Additional information on** [Restitution Orders and Interim Injunctions to Freeze Assets](https://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/03111.html)

In order to proceed on a criminal track both of the following criteria must be satisfied: (1) there must be clear and compelling evidence suggesting that the accused knowingly or recklessly made a false or misleading representation to the public. An example of such evidence is the continuation of a practice by the accused after complaints have been made by consumers directly to the accused; and (2) the Bureau must also be satisfied that criminal prosecution would be in the public interest. More information on the choice of track is available from the following publication [*Misleading Representations and Deceptive Marketing Practices: Choice of Criminal or Civil Track Under the* Competition Act](https://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/01223.html).
