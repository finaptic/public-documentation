# Complaint Handling Policy and Procedures

## Introduction

Finaptic and it's partners have  an obligation to have an appropriate and effective written policy and procedure for dealing with complaints fairly and in compliance with consumer protection regulations.

This document describes how customer complaints, including reportable complaints, as defined by regulation, are managed by the Distribution Partners, Finaptic, and Finaptic's banking license partner (the "**Bank**") in an effective, accessible and timely manner.

## Definition of a Complaint

A consumer complaint is generally understood to be an expression of dissatisfaction with a product or service made by a customer, and to which a response is expected, whether that be a specific response like a financial reimbursement, or a less specific response such as improvement of a function or feature.

## Regulatory Definition of Complaint

Under banking legislation, the current Complaints Regulation defines complaint as a complaint that is made by a person

(a) to a bank or an authorized foreign bank about a product or service that was requested or received by the person from the bank or authorized foreign bank; or

(b) to an external complaints body about a product or service that was requested or received by the person from a member of that body.

The upcoming new definition of complaint under Bill C-86 will expand the definition of complaint to include the term dissatisfaction, adopting a more consumer protection approach. A complaint is deemed a complaint whether or not it is justified: complaint means dissatisfaction, whether justified or not, expressed to an institution with respect to

(a) a product or service in Canada that is offered, sold or provided by the institution; or

(b) the manner in which a product or service in Canada is offered, sold or provided by the institution.

Further the definition of complaint no longer requires an action from the customer to &#39;request or receive&#39; the product or service - the complaint can be with respect to the offer, sale or provision of the product or service by the institution. The change in language is meant to address complaints related to questionable sales practices by financial institutions that have been under considerable scrutiny by the FCAC the past number of years. It applies to the Bank as it is the financial institution that &#39;provides&#39; the products the Distribution Partner is offering and selling to its customers.

The broader definition of a &#39;complaint&#39; is coming into force on June 30, 2022. Finaptic will continue to follow the FCAC Procedures for Reportable Complaints, as referenced below, and the current definition of &#39;complaint&#39; until such time as the Bank requires Finaptic to make changes to comply with new regulations.

## Complaint Submission Procedures

There are several ways a customer can communicate a complaint - and upon investigation may be found to be a Reportable Complaint as defined by regulation.

A customer can submit a complaint through one or more of the following channels:

- By calling the Distribution partner&#39;s customer service toll-free telephone number
- By sending a secure message or initiating a chat in the Distribution Partner&#39;s Mobile App
- By submitting a complaint in writing through direct mail to the Distribution Partner
- By contacting the Bank through any of its&#39; channels
- By contacting the External Ombudsman disclosed in product documents and the Distribution Partner&#39;s electronic channels
- By contacting the FCAC

All complaints, no matter the source or the channel through which it is received, must be recorded in a complaint log and the template details must be completed.

## Levels of Complaint Management and Roles

- Direct contact with customer (front line) - Distribution Partner
- 2nd level complaint management (escalation) - Finaptic
- Ombudsman
- FCAC

### Distribution Partner

The primary role of the Distribution Partner&#39;s customer support, whether it be through a call center, in App or in writing, is to provide the customer assistance with the app functionality, technical support, and publicly available information regarding the product. Customer support representatives receive training specific to handling customer inquiries in the financial services industry, and use a script to obtain consent to assist the customer and view their information. Partner's must use the supplied **Complaints Triage document** that specifies the types of inquiries they are permitted to assist with. All complaints must be logged according to instructions provided by Finaptic, as detailed in the Complaints Log document, calls and chats are recorded for monitoring and control. If the Distribution Partner is unable to resolve the issue to the customer's satisfaction or the issue requires additional support, a ticket will be opened and the Finaptic team will receive an alert to assist with the complaint.

### Finaptic

Finaptic will manage all escalations as described in the Complaints Triage and document steps taken in the Complaints Log for the relevant Distribution Partner.
