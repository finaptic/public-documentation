# Customer Support Inquiry Flow

Finaptic provides escalation customer support when it comes to banking-related issues. We do not provide first-line support for any partner-specific application questions or issues. Finaptic provides, as part of our SDK and services, customer support channels, technology, and escalation paths.

## Definition of Customer service levels

### Level 0 - Self Serve

Self-serve is defined by services and questions that are resolvable through the partner's mobile app, partner's website, or a partner managed chat bot. The partner is shall create self-service FAQs for their own application.

### Level 1 - Distribution Partners Agent Support

The partner is responsible for providing a contact point for all first interactions. Support either by call center with a live agent, chat with a live agent or chat bot.

### Level 2 - Finaptic 

Finaptic is responsible for providing assistance if level 1 support is unable to provide resolution when it related to banking specific issues. Escalation will will be initiated by the level 1 customer support agent through the in-app secure chat API.

### Level 3 - Finaptic (Fraud Operations)

Finaptic is responsible for suspected fraud and transaction dispute investigations. These will be escalated internally at Finaptic through the level 2 support agent.
